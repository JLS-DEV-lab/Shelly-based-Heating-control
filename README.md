# Shelly-based-Heating-control
Shelly Pro 4PM automated Heating control for a shared office solution.


In the scope of this software development is a Shelly module, with which it is possible to switch the heating automated. To achieve this goal, a Shelly Pro 4PM module
will be integrated into an existing circuit and added to the existing network. Control and monitoring is to be implemented via a rudimentary web interface. The data
exchange will be done via MQTT and SFTP.
